00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,180
In my last video,

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,270
I shared eight steps

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,370
that you can use

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,470
to introduce a

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,560
guest speaker at

6
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,660
an online event.

7
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,220
In today's video, I'll

8
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,340
put those eight steps

9
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,460
to practice by

10
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,590
showing you how

11
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,710
to use it.

12
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,830
Let's dive in.

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,580
Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome to the Enterprise U Virtual Event.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,030
I am super excited to have you here. Excited about all the amazing conversations

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,450
that we're gonna have today. Now, before we begin, let me remind you of one thing.

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,160
We won't be recording today's session.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,550
This is a safe space

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,290
Here, there is no judgment,

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,490
no repercussions,

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,170
only

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,570
unconditional love,

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,340
Joining us today is a super woman and an amazing

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,150
visionary.

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,980
And when I say

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,780
amazing,

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,700
I mean it.

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,630
What's special about her is that she loves helping young adults just like you

28
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,430
to build your public speaking confidence.

29
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,920
She believes that the distance between you and everything you want is only

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,890
one communication away. As you listen to her story,

31
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,090
you'll notice

32
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,370
the power in your own voice.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,360
Today, she'll be sharing her top storytelling and pitching tips to help you with your next business presentation

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,530
or job interview.

35
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,000
